# Basic starter bot for using Conversation Learner SDK

This repo is to help developers quickly get started with a node js bot leveraging the Conversation Learner SDK to drive the dialog flow. 

If you haven't already - please check out the documentation for the project available at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/labs/conversation-learner/quickstart.

Developers who are new to Conversation Learner are encouraged to follow the quick start guide and use the Official Samples repository @ https://github.com/Microsoft/ConversationLearner-Samples to get started.

Once you get a hang of how things work, you can use the code in this repository to start experimenting with your own bots.

Note: The bot in this repo is configured to run the Conversation Learner UI on the same port as the bot (default:3978) unlike the samples repo bot that has the UI running on a different port (default: 5050) to the bot.
